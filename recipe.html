                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the blended red and green bell peppers, and sauté for about 5 minutes until the mixture thickens.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the blended tomatoes, thyme, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 10-15 minutes, allowing the sauce to reduce and the flavors to meld.</li>
                    <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot, stirring to coat the grains with the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, ensuring the rice is submerged. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
                    <li>If using, add the protein of your choice during the last 10 minutes of cooking.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and serve hot, garnished with fried plantains or your choice of protein.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a smoky flavor, you can cook the rice over low heat for a longer time or use a charcoal grill to infuse a smoky aroma.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the spice level by adding more or fewer chilies according to your taste.</li>
                    <li>Serve with fried plantains, coleslaw, or a side salad for a complete meal.</li>
                </ul>
