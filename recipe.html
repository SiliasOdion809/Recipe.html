        <h1>Jollof Rice(Nigerian Style)</h1>
        <p>
          Jollof Rice is a vibrant and flavorful West African dish made by
          cooking rice in a rich blend of tomatoes, peppers, onions, and spices.
          In the Nigerian style, it’s often smoky, slightly spicy, and served
          with fried plantain, chicken, beef, or fish. Loved for its bold taste
          and beautiful orange-red color, it’s a staple at parties, family
          gatherings, and celebrations.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak for 30
            minutes, then drain.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the
            chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the blended tomatoes, red bell pepper, and Scotch bonnet peppers
            to the pot. Cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally,
            until the mixture thickens and the oil begins to separate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in the thyme, curry powder, and salt. Add the drained rice and
            mix well to coat the rice with the tomato mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, ensuring the rice is
            submerged. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover
            the pot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook for 30-40 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid
            is absorbed. Avoid opening the lid frequently.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once cooked, fluff the rice with a fork and let it sit for 5 minutes
            before serving.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking tips</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <u>Use Long-Grain Parboiled Rice</u>
          </li>
          <p>
            Long-grain parboiled rice is preferred for Jollof rice because it
            holds its shape well and absorbs flavors without becoming mushy.
          </p>
          <li>
            <u>Fry the Tomato-Pepper Base Well</u>
          </li>
          <p>
            Ensure the tomato-pepper base is well-fried to enhance the flavor
            and achieve the desired richness.
          </p>
          <li>
            <u>Season Generously</u>
          </li>
          <p>
            Don’t be afraid to add salt and spices to the rice. The flavors
            should be bold and well-balanced.
          </p>
          <li>
            <u>Control the Water</u>
          </li>
          <p>
            Be mindful of the liquid-to-rice ratio. Too much water can make the
            rice mushy, while too little can result in undercooked rice.
          </p>
          <li>
            <u>Cook on Low Heat for the “Party Jollof” Smoky Flavor</u>
          </li>
          <p>
            For a smokier flavor, you can cook the rice over a low flame and let
            it "burn" slightly at the bottom.
          </p>
          <li>
            <u>Use Stock Instead of Plain Water</u>
          </li>
          <p>
            Using chicken or vegetable stock instead of plain water adds depth
            and richness to the dish.
          </p>
          <li>
            <u>Don’t Stir Too Often</u>
          </li>
          <p>
            Once you add the rice to the pot, avoid stirring too much. This
            helps prevent the rice from becoming mushy and allows it to cook
            evenly.
          </p>
          <li>
            <u>Let It Rest</u>
          </li>
          <p>
            After cooking, let the Jollof rice rest for a few minutes before
            serving. This allows the flavors to meld and the rice to firm up
            slightly.
          </p>
